## AtliQ Hardware Data Analytics Project

AtliQ Hardware is embarking on a journey to implement data analytics using Power BI to drive informed decision-making across various departments. This project aims to provide comprehensive insights to stakeholders, enabling them to surpass competitors in the market.

### Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware faces the challenge of making strategic decisions across diverse departments without access to real-time, comprehensive data insights. This lack of transparency hinders the company's ability to identify market trends, optimize operations, and maximize profitability. By implementing a robust data analytics solution with Power BI, AtliQ aims to overcome these challenges and achieve a 10% increase in profit through data-driven decision-making.

## Company and Sales Structure

### Types of Customers:
- Brick and Mortar: Physical stores like Croma and Best Buy.
- E-Commerce: Online stores like Amazon and Flipkart.

### Sales Channels 
- Retailers: Includes both Brick and Mortar and E-Commerce platforms.
- Direct Channel: AtliQ's own stores.
- Distributors: When AtliQ can't sell directly, they sell to a distributor who then supplies various stores.

### Report Contents

1. **Finance View**: Displays profit and loss statements to analyze financial performance across markets, products, and customers.

2. **Sales View**: Presents top and bottom customers with key metrics. A matrix format is preferred for a comprehensive understanding of their performance.
